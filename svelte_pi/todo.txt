You're absolutely right to ask this! Yes, you can and **should** use both - they serve different purposes:

## .venv (for development) + pipx (for installation)

**Your current setup is perfect for development:**
```bash
# Development workflow (keep doing this)
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .  # For testing changes
svelte-pi create  # Test your code
```

**Use pipx for "production" installation:**
```bash
# When you want to actually use the tool globally
deactivate  # Exit your venv
pipx install -e .  # Install globally with isolated deps
```

## Why Both?

1. **`.venv`** - For developing and testing svelte-pi
   - Install dependencies locally
   - Test changes immediately with `pip install -e .`
   - Keep development isolated

2. **`pipx`** - For actually using svelte-pi as a CLI tool
   - Global command availability
   - Dependencies stay isolated from system Python
   - Can be used from any directory

## Workflow

```bash
# Development mode
cd svelte-pi
source .venv/bin/activate
# Make changes to code
pip install -e .  # Reinstall after changes
svelte-pi create  # Test

# When ready to use globally
deactivate
pipx install -e .  # Now works everywhere
cd ~/anywhere
svelte-pi create  # Works globally
```

## The Beauty

- **Development**: Virtual env keeps your dev dependencies clean
- **Distribution**: pipx keeps the installed tool's dependencies isolated
- **No conflicts**: Each serves its purpose perfectly

You're already doing the hard part right with `.venv` for development!
